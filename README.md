Namecheap.com WHMCS Registrar plug-in is an open-source plug-in that is distributed free of charge. It focuses on integrating Namecheap as a domain registrar at WHMCS.

After the integration you can setup Namecheap as the default registrar for your customers and decide which services and TLDs to offer to your customers from within the WHMCS admin area.

##### Pre-requisites

- Access to WHMCS admin area.
- An understanding of Namecheap’s environments.
- Namecheap account with API access enabled on the desired environment.

NOTE: Namecheap has a production as well as a test server environment. The test server environment is called Sandbox. We urge you to test the WHMCS Registrar plug-in in our sandbox environment, before pointing it to production. For more detailed information, please visit the developer's site at http://www.namecheap.com/support/api/api.aspx

##### Download and Installation

- Download the latest plugin (namecheap-whmcs.x.x.zip) archive and extract it.
- Create a folder called namecheap under Modules/Registrar in your WHMCS root directory and paste the downloaded namecheap.php and namecheapapi.php files inside the folder (the namecheap.php and namecheapapi.php files are located inside the downloaded archive). The plug-in installation is complete.

##### Configuration

To configure WHMCS for use with Namecheap, perform the following steps:

1. Login to your **WHMCS admin** panel.
2. Click on **Setup** menu, select **Products/Services** and click on **Domain Registrars**.
3. Click on Activate next to Namecheap in the list:

5. Optional settings:

You can refer to http://docs.whmcs.com/Domains_Configuration for more information.

To add additional fields required for our module (language for IDN domains, Job Title field for .CA and .AU domains, extended attributed for .FR domains) you will need to connect our own additionaldomainfields.php file. To do this, please add the following strings in the end of includes/additionaldomainfields.php file:

 `if (file_exists(dirname(FILE)."/../modules/registrars/namecheap/additionaldomainfields.php")) {
  include dirname(FILE)."/../modules/registrars/namecheap/additionaldomainfields.php"; 
 }`
